Work split and references
All work was split three ways at all times although Kate allocated more time to css and styling than paritchamon and Evan as she preferred that aspect but also contributed to the classes as well Paritchamon and Evan both worked on the classes and testing as well as kate to ensure a fair and even split at all times making sure that no one was left with doing all the work this was achieved with weekly teams meetings in person and egular messaging through whatsapp imessage and snapchat while also using email at times we also used Trello to manage checklists for the project. Github was used on a consistent basis to share work and ensure version control although paritchamon barnwells laptop was having problems with hosting the repo locally so her work was often sent through signal to Kate or Evan to ensure it was put up on the repo this is being stated in case of questioning as to why her git commits may seem low.
We all thoroughly enjoyed working on the project and the challenges that came with it and would definitelyreccomend the module to others.
